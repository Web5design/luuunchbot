Simple sinatra app that listens on Instagram webhooks and performs
actions each time your subscription webhook gets called.

For luuunch.com, when ever I had an image with the #luuunch tag,
it would publish a post to Instagram/Tumblr.

Creating the instagram subscription was done manually via curl as per
the api guide:

curl -F 'client_id=CLIENT-ID' \
     -F 'client_secret=CLIENT-SECRET' \
     -F 'object=user' \
     -F 'aspect=media' \
     -F 'verify_token=myVerifyToken' \
     -F 'callback_url=http://YOUR-CALLBACK/URL' \
